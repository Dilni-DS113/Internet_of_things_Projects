### Unit: SWE30011
## Individual project: Water level monitor
Individually, I crafted an IoT setup with a sensor and actuator, gathering data into a SQL database and documenting the process comprehensively.

## Group Project: Smart home device
Subsequently, within a team, we created a more intricate IoT system with 2 sensors, Arduino boards and 4 actuators. This system collected data in an external SQL database for easy webpage access. A detailed joint report was also done.
